@article{Wu:2004wn,
	abstract = {Replication-competent viruses have the potential to overcome the delivery barrier in tumors that has plagued traditional gene-therapy approaches to cancer treatment. However, recent clinical data suggests that a cytokine-based immune response against the virus-infected tumor cells may severely limit the efficacy of the replication-competent approach. This paper generalizes our earlier spatial model to incorporate an immune response against the infected tumor cells. An approximate but accurate condition is derived for the virus---if uniformly injected throughout the tumor---to eradicate the tumor in the presence of the immune response. To validate the model using clinical data describing the temporal interaction of tumor necrosis factor and free virus in the plasma, we needed the immune response to be time-delayed and experience either saturated stimulation or second-order clearance. The resulting estimates of some unknown parameters provide some implications for the delivery of treatment.},

@article{OKAMOTO2014166,
	abstract = {The specific targeting of tumor cells by replication-competent oncolytic viruses is considered indispensable for realizing the potential of oncolytic virotherapy. Yet off-target infections by oncolytic viruses may increase virus production, further reducing tumor load. This ability may be critical when tumor-cell scarcity or the onset of an adaptive immune response constrain viral anti-tumoral efficacy. Here we develop a mathematical framework for assessing whether oncolytic viruses with reduced tumor-specificity can more effectively eliminate tumors while keeping losses to normal cell populations low. We find viruses that infect some normal cells can potentially balance the competing goals of tumor elimination and minimizing the effects on normal cell populations. Particularly when infected tissues can be regenerated, moderating rather than completely eliminating the ability of oncolytic viruses to infect and lyse normal cells could improve cancer treatment, with potentially fewer side-effects than conventional treatments such as chemotherapy.},
